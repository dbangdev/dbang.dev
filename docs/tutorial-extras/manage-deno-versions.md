# Manage Deno Versions

Deno is wonderful production for version compatibility, but sometimes you need special version of Deno to run the script. You can use `--deno version` to assign Deno version for script, and commands
as follows:

```shell
dbang --deno 1.17.1 hello@github_user
```

Don't worry about Deno installation, and dbang will download and install Deno automatically.

# Commands for Deno version Management

```shell
dbang deno install 1.17.1
dbang deno list
dbang deno delete 1.17.1
```
